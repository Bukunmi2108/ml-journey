Today,

- learnt eigen-vectors and eigen-values, vectors that do not get push off their spans during transformations.
- learnt that mathematics deals, greatly, in abstraction.
- there are axioms, fundamental rules that guide deductive reasoning and mathematical thing and all.
- functions were also proved to be vectors, don't yet know how that work?
- basis vectors are linearly independent and they span across the whole vector space.
